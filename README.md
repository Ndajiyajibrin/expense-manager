## Expense manager

A Flutter app that parses your bank alert data and gives you an insight into your spending

### How it works?

The app uses permission to access your text messages on your mobile phone, filters those text using your banking institution and then categorizes the filtered messages into credits and debits with information about their description and the amount.

### Note
This was a weekend "hack" project. At the time of building this, there weren't any public accessible tooling to access user bank data, so I settled for the hacky approach.
